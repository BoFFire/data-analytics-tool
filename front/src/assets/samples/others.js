        "Thinking out loud about Phoenix, Real Estate, and Phoenix Real Estate - a Chris Butterworth site\nTuesday, February 12, 2008\nHow many houses should I see before making an offer?\nMy historical answer (as politically correct as it may be) has been \"as many as it takes.\" I've worked with enough buyers to know that people are inherently different; some will buy the first house they see, while others will look at homes for months, or even years, before they're ready to make the move. But that's ok ��� I've always strived to give top-level service, regardless of how long it takes.\nI figure that over the long haul it all balances out, and I end up with lots of happy clients. I've even assumed that the clients I worked with for a long time would appreciate my service that much more, since I didn't do as much to help my shorter-term clients find their home.\nThat may not be the case. I've spent some time reviewing my business, looking at where my referrals have come from, and what type of client referred them. Turns out a significantly higher percentage of my referrals come from clients who picked out a home on the first or second time we went out looking.\nWhat does this mean? Maybe these clients are happier & more decisive in general, and more apt to make a referral. Maybe the longer my clients work with me, the less they like me (although I hope this isn't the case!) Maybe the more homes a client looks at, the more overwhelmed they become, and ultimately the less happy they are with the entire process. I think there's some validity to this last point..\nBarry Schwartz wrote a book in 2004 called The Paradox of Choice: Why More is Less. In it he talks about the overwhelming amount of choice exhausting our brains, ultimately restricting instead of freeing us. 900 cable channels but nothing good on tv? Easy fit, relaxed fit, and loose fit jeans, but none of them fit right? I think Schwartz's theory is currently being acted out in our over-supplied real estate market.\nTim Ferris wrote an excellent piece on this same topic last week (which actually started me down the road of analyzing my own business.) He went to Barnes and Noble to exchange a book ��� a five minute errand, right? 30 minutes later, feeling completely overwhelmed, he left the store with the same book he had originally brought in!\nHow many houses should you see before making an offer? As many as it takes to find one you love. However, if you can convince yourself to buy the first one you love, at a reasonable price, odds are you'll be happier than if you force yourself to see all 100 homes available in your area before making a decision.\nFood for thought, anyway.\nYour occasionally falls victim to paralysis by analysis Realtor,\nChris Butterworth\n[tags] inventory, Tim Ferris, Why More is Less, Fletcher Heights [/tags]",

On Monday, the US government said it would allow entry until people were fully vaccinated.\nHowever, it is not yet clear which vaccines the country���s officials will accept.\n���We believe the AstraZeneca vaccine is safe,��� European Commission spokesman Eric Mammer told a news conference.\n���From our point of view, it obviously makes sense for people who have been vaccinated with AstraZeneca to be able to travel,��� but he also said it is a decision for US officials.\nThe agency responsible for this issue in the US is the FDA (equivalent to Anvisa in Brazil).

        "OCTOBER 6, 2018\nEricsson eyes Indycar move\nMarcus Ericsson has admitted his next move could be out of formula one and into Indycar.\nThe Swede has been signed up to stay at Sauber next year as reserve driver, but he is quoted by Brazil's Globo as indicating he also wants to keep racing.\n\"We're also talking to teams in other categories,\" said the 28-year-old.\n\"I see myself returning to formula one in the future, and in order to be able to, I want to continue to race in fast single seater cars. Indy is the best championship to do that,\" Ericsson added.\nHe said Formula E is not a major consideration.\n\"It's definitely one of the options and interesting in many ways, but it may not be the best to stay in the type of racing as formula one. Formula E is more of a career move.\n\"There are some better options to keep you on the radar to return here,\" said Ericsson.\n(GMM)",

        "The demographics of the most popular social networking sites are changing quickly and, once again, the team at Flowtown has done a great job of compiling the latest statistics about Facebook users and social network usage in general. Did you know that the average age of a Facebook user is 38 years old? Even more interesting is that 61% of Facebook users are now older than 38 ��� the company has come a long way since first launching exclusively to an audience of college students.\nAnd what about Twitter? The average Twitter user is 39, and 64% of tweeters are 35 or older.\nAnother interesting statistic found in the data is that social media users who are 18 to 29 use social networks almost as much as they use e-mail; other reports have recently suggested that users under 18 use social networks more than e-mail.\nCheck out all the details below!",

        "The 123rd episode of our 12 Questions segment features producer Giddyhead.\n1. If you had to pick one track which solidified your love for electronic music early on what would it be?\nNo particular one, might be from VHS tapes, ambient music from films and surf videos from the 80���s.\n2. What was your first and last DJ gig?\nNot long ago, July 2011. The last one was November 27 at the presentation of Inti Burn, the community around Burning Man in Argentina. It will take place in a valley in April 2015.\n3. What was the first and last record you purchased?\nThe first one was Loco Live ��� The Ramones and the last one was Permiso ��� Jose Larralde.\n4. What would you say is the highlight of your career thus far?\nIn 2012, played by Hernan Cattaneo for the first time can be a highlight. Or a feedback from Sigur Ros by email about my remix. It reads: ���hey cesar, thanks for the mail! thanks for taking the time to make the remix and glad its getting recognition! darren. sigur-ros.co.uk��� Hernan has drawn a smile on my face several times, Sigur Ros are so amazing and you might guess my feeling. My first release: ���Constanza (Eight Degrees South)��� and the support of Lee Burridge, a personal highlight, if you know what I mean.\nBasically is a lot of work and everything has its own moment or characteristic of importance in different ways. Some time ago when I had the chance to remix the cover of ���Pale Blue Eyes��� recorded by Moby and Julie Mintz(from his own Pro Tools session)and sending to her the different demos to finally read: I love both (Julie Mintz) but Moby said that the second one is the best. I realized that I was getting a feedback from Moby and as if it wasn���t enough Darrell Thorp supported the track, a 3 times Grammy Award winning, the man behind Radiohead, Atoms For Peace, Beck and many more, I cannot describe that moment.\nI mean, is all about love.\n5. Tell us something about yourself that might surprise people?\n2011-Groove Armada-Red Light remix competition- Andy Cato said this about my remix: ���The change at 3.39 is lovely. The classic major/minor thing that in this context works really well. The remix has been approached from a really musical angle. I���m not sure you need the extra part that appears initally at 0.46 and then again at 4.13. It takes up a lot of space in the middle, and holds back the roll a bit. The opening would make a fantastic drop. I think you could go between that and the 3.39 change initially without the original bass part, just those lovely chords from the opening. Then the second time around, a bit of extra top end and the filtered original bassline. There you would have a peak time Sasha tune.���\n6. Who are some of the best undiscovered talents in your eyes?\nThe last undiscovered talent I met was a lady from Buenos Aires, she doesn���t look worry about being recognized as a new talent so I will just say her real name, I hope she don���t mind. We (a small group of friends) were sharing a few days in a Estancia in the outskirts of Buenos Aires. Devorah plays a n���goni and sing. We share some influences from Indu, African and World Music, who knows maybe we meet someday to make a collab. I was shocked by her mixture of styles and my feeling was.. this is something like Sigur Ros and Amadou & Mariam, hard to explain but a very strong feeling of conciousness and love.\n7. Which producers consistently inspire you?\nI always take a care listening to different djs and producers like Ricardo Villalobos, Lee Burridge, Guy Gerber, Steve Bug and others. Now with ��me, Matthias Meyer, Gardens Of God, Gab Rhome, YokoO and others we have great artists on the go.\n8. What artist or track would you love to remix? and who would you love to be remixed by?\nI would love to remix to Tom Waits and I would love to be remixed by Matthew Dekay.\n9. Record labels are a dime a dozen these days, which ones if any standout for you?\nDer Dritte Raum, Cocoon, Ellum, Cadenza, Warp Records, Innervisions, All Day I Dream, microCastle, Hot Creations, SudBeat, Maeve, Last Night On Earth, liebe*detail. On the other hand, labels like Sound Avenue, Agara Music and many others which takes new artists on scene have also an important role.\n10. What would you say is the best mix compilation of all time?\nI don���t feel confortable saying what���s the best but the first time I was listening to Perfecto and I met with the voice of ���You are sleeping��� was love on first sight, but Renaissance, Global Underground, Sven Vath stuff. Every work done by these people has a huge impact, Hernan, Sasha, Sven, Nick Warren, Diggers, they have all gave a Master Class.\n11. Current Favourites (you can list more than one per category if you like)\nFood: Gluten Free (No choice)\nDrink: The Glenlivet 12 Year Old\nDrug: Whatever you do, don���t tell anyone\nAnimal: Perry, my dog\nTV Show: Pensado���s Place\nMovie: The Wall\nVideo Game: No I don���t\nAlbum: Hail To The Thief\nTrack / Song: Two Dots\nProducer / Band: Edward Kennedy ���Duke��� Ellington\nRecord Label: Mute ��� All Day I Dream\nNightclub: Kristal Glam Club ��� Warung\nDJ: Lee Burridge ��� Hernan Cattaneo ��� Ricardo Villalobos ��� Danny Howells\n12. If the final DJ/live set of your career was next week what would your last track be?\nQuilla ��� A Million Broken Bikes (Ricardo Villalobos & Shaun Reeves Remix)\nGiddyhead���s remix of Ozgur Ozkan ���Cholera Street��� is out now on Agara Music, you can purchase the release: here",

Seeing the Statue of David at literally every single tourist location and then seeing the real thing at the Galleria dell���Accademia. Its historic buildings and quirky touches. Not to mention the Floretine roofscape! Those terra cotta tiles that seem to cover every single building in Florence. I just couldn���t get over how pretty Florence was not just from ground level, but also from above. One of the highlights from my trip was climbing the hundreds of steps up to Piazzale Michelangelo (where once again, we saw another David). The view of Florence from Piazzale Michelangelo was unsurpassed. There was a busker singing acoustic love songs in front of the beautiful panoramic backdrop of Florence and there was literally so much romance in the air that I almost expected to see someone be proposed to! The entire vibe of the city was one that was laid back and local. It was such an enchanting place to stay and a stop not to be missed. It was really Italy at its best.\n������ 15.03.13 | outfit\n, travel\n������",

        "Your Tenancy\nYour tenancy agreement is an important legal document\nIt details your rights and responsibilities as our tenant and our rights and responsibilities as your landlord.\nAll tenancies are unique in terms of dates and who is listed on the tenancy, so please make sure you have read and understood your personal tenancy agreement as it will be this individual document which will have your specific information on it.\nThe headings on this page contain general information which applies to all customers.\nIf you have a specific query about your tenancy, or cannot find your tenancy agreement and would like to request a copy, please Contact Us.\nIf you are looking to end a tenancy, please expand the \"Ending A Tenancy\" heading.\nWe're making your tenancy more secure!\nWe���re in the process of converting over 800 Probationary and Fixed Term Affordable Rent Tenancies into Lifetime Tenancies.\nThis means if you live in an Affordable Tenancy home (properties that have been capped at the level to be no more than 80% of local market rent), we���ll be asking you to sign a new tenancy agreement for a lifetime tenancy (this ensures the customer holding the lifetime tenancy has the right to stay in the property for as long as they are alive).\nWhy are we doing this?\nAffordable Rent Tenancies were originally introduced in the form of Fixed Term Tenancies (a tenancy lasting 5 or 10 years). Some customers were worried about losing their homes at the end of the fixed period and there have been occasions with mutual exchanges where applicants have refused to exchange due to lack of security. We have looked at current legislation and terms of the Tenancy Agreements and it is now agreed that we are able to grant Affordable Rent Tenancies on a Lifetime Tenancy. These are periodic tenancies running from month to month with no end date.\nAll our new Affordable Rent Tenancies will be either probationary or Lifetime, with the probationary ones automatically converting to lifetime.\nWe do however have some historical tenancies that are still on Fixed Term and we will be contacting these customers to convert their tenancies so none of our customers are at a disadvantage.\nOur dedicated team are working through the process and will be calling customers affected to support you through this by helping you sign the new tenancy agreement through Adobe Sign digitally where possible.\nChanges you need to tell us about\nIt is important that you let us know if your or your joint tenant's circumstances or contact details change.\nFor example, if:\n- you change your name through marriage or divorce\n- you want to add or remove someone from your tenancy\n- a joint tenant leaves the property\nYou need to let us know so that we can update your tenancy.\nIn addition, if your contact details change you also need to let us know as soon as possible. This is important in case we need to contact you in an emergency - for example, if you or a neighbour have a burst pipe we may need to get in touch with you without you being aware that a repair is needed.\nIf possible, please provide us with a telephone or mobile number for emergencies, and an email address so that we can contact you with less urgent news in an unobtrusive way.\nEnding A Tenancy\nIf you are leaving your property:\nYou must give us written notice to end your tenancy. You can give us notice by completing our Customer Notice to Quit Form (using Adobe Sign).\nYour tenancy agreement will say how much notice you need to give. It will be either four weeks ending on a Sunday or one calendar month.\nBefore you move on we need to remind you about a few things you need to do to make sure the house is left clear and in a good condition. For more information please view our Property Condition Leaflet [pdf] 2MB.\nGas Safety When Moving House\nWhen moving house you have a legal obligation to make sure your former home is in a gas safe condition. Gas appliances must be disconnected and removed safely by a Gas Safe engineer. You can find a Gas Safe engineer by clicking here.\nFor more information please download our Gas Safety Information Leaflet [pdf] 30KB. For help and advice please call us on 0333 200 7304.\nEnding A Tenancy On Another's Behalf:\nIn the unfortunately event that you need to end a tenancy because one of our customers has died, gone into care, or any other reason then there is a legal process we have to follow.\nWe understand this can be an incredibly difficult time, but please let us know as soon as possible by filling out our Notice To Quit On Behalf Of A Customer form (using Adobe Sign). If you need advice you can also call us on 0333 200 7304 and we will do whatever we can to support you.\nWe can only accept notice if you are the next of kin or are legally acting on behalf of the tenant - for example if you are the executor of their will, have been appointed an administrator by the Probate Office or have power of attorney. You can find out more about this and what you need to do on the gov.uk website.\nWe will ask you to provide confirmation that you have the legal right to end the tenancy. If there is no executor or administrator, we have to serve notice on the Public Trustee to end the tenancy.\nRight to Buy\nFollowing a recent Government announcement for an extension of the Right to Buy scheme, Platform Housing Group have not been provided with any further information at this time.

        "STAFF WRITER\nBERLIN - With its most difficult part of the schedule ahead of it, the Berlin football team appears to be hitting its stride at just the right time.\nThe Redcoats played perhaps their most complete game of the season last Friday against Tolland. Led by quarterback Kevin Dunn, who accounted for five total touchdowns - four in the air and one on the ground - Berlin (7-0) rallied past the Eagles 41-10.\nBut will that be enough for tonight���s opponent?\n���We���re going into Bloomfield full force,��� running back James Mazzarella said. ���We���re putting everything we got into this game because we want to show teams who we are as Berlin.���\n���We have to play to our full potential,��� offensive linemen Dominic Lattarulo said. ���Based on previous weeks, we���ve overcome a lot of adversity on the field but this is our biggest test this year.���\nThe Warhawks have only one loss, a Week 2 24-16 loss to now 13th-ranked Rocky Hill, and Bloomfield���s offense, which averages 36 points a game, will present the Redcoats with their toughest challenge yet.\nBloomfield relies on junior Ky���juon Butler as its primary running back. Butler has amassed 1,100 yards and 11 touchdowns on just 122 carries this season, averaging 9.8 yards per carry. And while he is one of the major focal points of the Warhawks��� offense, the team also has sophomore running back Anthony Simpson, who has rushed the ball 45 times for 454 yards (10.1 yards per carry) and has 10 total touchdowns.\nBut Bloomfield has shown it is capable of throwing the ball as well. The Warhawks��� freshman quarterback, Daron Bryden, has also made quite an entrance himself, completing 69.2 percent of his passes for 1,197 yards and 15 touchdowns to just five interceptions.\nBerlin head coach Joe Aresimowicz is uncertain how his team is going to play the ball tonight. Depending on what Bloomfield brings to the field, determines the Redcoats��� pace of play.\n���[It���s going to depend] on what their defense is giving us,��� Aresimowicz said. ���It puts our defense in a big spot.���\nPerhaps the most important aspect for the Redcoats tonight will be how well they play collectively as a unit on each side of the ball. Earlier in the season, one of Berlin���s issues were players not communicating effectively on the field. As such, the Redcoats stopped using reward decals on their helmets as a way to put more emphasis on team play instead of focusing on the individual.\n���They bought in,��� Aresimowicz said. ���Not only did we stop handing them out, but they took them all off their helmets. They bought into the team aspect.���\nAnd that could be the difference between a win and a loss not only for tonight, but moving forward as well.\n���We���re actually playing as a team and you can tell by the scores of the last three games,��� Mazzarella said. ���People have been saying Tolland was supposed to be our biggest game, but right now these last three [Bloomfield, Rocky Hill and New Britain] are the toughest games of our schedule and we really just need to come together, focus every single day at practice and show these teams what we have.���",
        "A week after her oldest daughter tested positive for the coronavirus, Jennifer Santana and four other members of her family received a positive test.\nThe Buford family has been quarantining for more than three weeks, and Santana said returning to work might not happen until the middle of August.\n���We went to get tested and it came out we were all negative. We didn���t think anything of it. Give or take about a week later after testing, like half of us came out positive,��� she said.\nThat included Santana, her husband, two of her daughters and a daughter-in-law.\nSantana described three days of more serious symptoms of high fever, nausea, back pain, trouble breathing and muscle pain that gradually faded.\nQuarantining has meant everybody staying in their rooms and only coming out with masks on, but the time away from work has caused strain on their finances and food.\nSantana said they were lucky to have some money saved but were thankful for a recent food drop-off facilitated by Hispanic Alliance GA.\n���I don���t know what we would have done,��� she said.\nVanesa Sarazua, executive director of Hispanic Alliance GA, discussed another man who had been in the hospital for months.\n\"He unfortunately has fallen behind on his rent, has fallen behind on his utilities, has lost his car, so we see those consequences of being sick and afflicted with this illness and how it has a long-term effect really on families and on poverty,��� she said. ���It really sets them back. Even if after they're able to recover, it'll take a while for them to be able to go back to work and have a normal life.\"\nSarazua said they served 550 families in a food drive-thru Saturday, July 11. They have also served anywhere from 30 to 75 families a week with food boxes being dropped off to families either sick, quarantining or without transportation.\n\"Now, pretty much it's more a reality for a lot of people where they know someone who has been sick, either in their family or at work or their friends. It's a more of a reality, and they see the seriousness of it a little bit more in our community,��� Sarazua said.\nA question-and-answer session with Dr. Antonio Rios had roughly 3,000 views on Facebook Live, the third installment of conversations with health officials for the community.\nRios, chief physician executive for Northeast Georgia Physicians Group, said the questions have been: When will the vaccine be available? What does the antibody test mean? Are masks helpful?\n\"What we're telling people is don't get your hopes too high on the antibody test, because it may mean you had it, but it may not be an insurance for you to just ignore all of our measures. We're still trying to message heavily to social distance, to wear masks, to wash hands, to avoid going to gatherings and things like that,��� Rios said.\nNortheast Georgia Health System provided data in April showing 49% of COVID-19 cases from Hall County are Latino. In April, 30% of cases were identified as Latino across the entire NGHS service area.\nHall County Breakdown of Positive Cases\n49% - Hispanic/Latino\n35% - White/Caucasian\n10% - Other/Unknown\n5% - African American/Black\nSource: NGHS\nService Area Breakdown of Positive Cases\n31% - Hispanic/Latino\n47% - White/Caucasian\n16% - Other/Unknown\n6% - African American/Black\nSource: NGHS\nThose numbers have not moved in three months. Data provided Tuesday, July 14, had 49% of Hall County���s cases being Latino and 31% across the entire NGHS service area.\nAccording to 2019 census estimates, 29% of Hall County is considered Latino.\nRios said he felt that the testing facilities have been ���saturated��� to the point where there is a delayed turnover in getting results.\n\"It's still here. It's not going away. You need to be really careful,��� Rios said.\nIn terms of recent trends, Rios said there has been an increase in those 18-40 who have been hospitalized.\nThe Times previously reported on how the poultry industry was tackling the best ways to prevent spread of the virus through various safety measures\n\"What we've seen is that the poultry industry is no longer a common denominator, and there hasn't been a single industry right now that really is highlighted as to where patients are working,��� Rios said.\nBetween Thursday, July 16, and Friday, July 17, the number of patients in the intensive care unit jumped from 16 to 31. The number of confirmed COVID-19 positive patients being treated also rose from 88 Thursday to 106 on Friday.\nThe hospital has not had more than 100 confirmed patients being treated since May 14, according to its online data.\nWith the opening of schools around the corner, Sarazua said she feels there will be a need for masks, hand sanitizer and other supplies.",

        "Thursday, 2 May 2013\nSavoury Flapjacks\nWell I can only urge you to put your prejudices aside and read on.\nThese flapjacks might better be called 'Cheesy Flapjacks' (does that sound any more appetising?!) and the recipe is taken from the brilliant 'Baby Led Weaning Cookbook' by Gill Rapley. I tend to make a half-sized batch of these, but as Ted is beginning to eat more and more (and I love to snack on them too) I think I'll start making the full amount. They are really useful portable snacks for babies, but if you don't have children to feed then please don't ignore this recipe, they're delicious for all ages!\nSavoury Flapjacks\n100g butter ( preferably unsalted if cooking for young children)\n300g porridge oats\n350g grated cheese (I usually use mature cheddar, but used 50% red leicester in my most recent batch which gave them an attractive orangey colour)\n2 beaten eggs\n200-300g of one of any of the following (grated): carrot, courgette red onion, sweet potato, swede or parsnip (the veg is an optional addition, but I usually grate in whatever veg I have in the fridge, just to make them extra-nutritious).\nPreheat oven to 180 and lightly grease a Swiss roll tin (for a half-batch I use my 20x20cm silicon pan).\nMelt butter in a pan over a low heat. Take off the heat and combine all ingredients in the pan, mixing well.\nPress down into the tin using the back of a spoon or fork. Bake for 20 minutes until golden brown (I usually find they need an extra 5-10 minutes, but that might just be my oven, or my own personal preference).\nAllow to cool for 5 minutes then cut into slices and turn out onto a wire rack (although if I've cooked mine in a silicon tray I let them cool in that before turning them out onto a wooden board and cutting them into slices).\nAnd my harshest food critic? He approves! Success.\n5 comments:\n- snowy said...\n-\nThese sound really interesting Kate. We love flapjacks, and there's always some left over veg lurking in the fridge.\n- 3 May 2013 14:29\n- nipitinthebud said...\n-\nmmmm they sound worth trying. I'll expect to see pics of Ted helping out next time {wink}\n- 4 May 2013 11:53\n-\n-\ncan't wait to try these!\n- 3 July 2013 14:58\n- Mama Melons said...\n-\nJust made a batch of these for all the picnics planned in this glorious weather. They look perfect. I also added poppy seeds. Thanks for posting the recipe.\n- 8 July 2013 11:39\n-\n-\nThanks for posting this, I was looking for it. I add thyme or parsley too, because my Mr 9 Months loves stronger flavours (curried egg mayonnaise, hummus with harissa, sag paneer!)\n- 27 December 2013 18:06",
        "today i���m posting a tutorial for skirting the issue, a campaign by liz and elizabeth of simple simon & co. to donate at least 100 skirts to girls in foster care by the beginning of august. i���m so happy to join in the effort!\nthe simons asked a bunch of bloggers to create simple skirt tutorials to share and inspire others to sew for this great cause (or anytime, really). since my little gal is only 4, my first thought was little gal skirts. a skirt is the first thing i sewed for her when she was just 15 months old, and remains a favorite thing to sew. my tutorial today is pretty simple, but it���s got some fun style. i���m also sharing a few general skirt making tips i���ve picked up over the past few years.\nfor the design, i was inspired by fruits ��� citrus, berries, and melons ��� the type of summertime fruit that my sisters and i sat outside and snacked on as kids, juice running everywhere, until we decided the best way to clean off was to run through the sprinkler. well���all but the lime, which was probably adding some flavor to mom ���s icy cold beverage as she kept an eye on us.\ni created an abstract color blocked skirt that gave me that summery feeling. i���m calling it the fruit stripe skirt!\nwe���ve got citrus in sizes 3T and 2T���\n���and melon and a berry varieties in sizes 4T and 18 months!\nthe colors are interchangeable; once you know the method, you can make your skirts in whatever style you���d like. best of all, these take very little time and require no hemming! let���s get sewing.\nMATERIALS\n- three cuts of fabric ��� you can make them fruitlike, like mine, or just pick any fun color/print combo in your stash. depending on your size you���ll need about 1/4 yd for the rind (green/yellow part), less than 1/4 yd for the pith (white part), and about 1/2 yd for the fruit (pink part). scraps work well here ��� use what you have!\n- for the seedy skirts: fabric paint (i used black for the watermelon and metallic gold for the strawberry), regular pencil with intact eraser, x-acto knife\n- 3/4��� elastic for the waistband\n- safety pin, water soluble marker, and a clothespin\nTUTORIAL ��� printing the seeds\ni thought it���d be fun to add seeds to the strawberry and watermelon skirts for a little extra dimension, so i���ll start with a quick how-to on those.\ntrim a teardrop shape out of your eraser with your x-acto knife. dip it in some fabric paint (i like to use a scrap of freezer paper as my paint palette ��� i dab off excess and practice on the paper before stamping the fabric). start stamping in a random pattern, with the point of the teardrop facing up. allow to dry, then heat-set with an iron.\nTUTORIAL ��� sewing the skirt\nseam allowances are 1/2��� unless otherwise specified\ni prefer to cut toddler/preschooler skirts selvage to selvage and have just one seam in the back, but if you need to cut two pieces like i did on a couple of these, that works too ��� you���ll just have side seams. just make sure all fabric widths are exactly the same ��� even if you cut the strips selvedge to selvedge they may differ slightly, so square them up and trim them all to match.\nyou���ll lose about 2��� of the pink fruit stripe to waistband and seam allowance, so for a 13��� finished skirt (4T), cut a 12��� pink (fruit) strip. add or subtract an inch per size larger/smaller (so for the fruit strip, cut 11��� for a 3T or 14��� for a 5). no matter the skirt size, i cut all of my cream strips at 2��� and my rind strips at 5��� (aside from the two-color strawberry, where i cut just a 6��� rind piece). finished, the cream stripe will be 1��� + 2��� green rind + 10��� pink fruit = 13��� 4T skirt.\nsew the short ends of each of the colors right sides together, so you have three tubes.\npress the rind seam allowance open. for the pith and fruit, serge to finish the seam allowances or trim to 1/4��� and zigzag. if serging, feed each new strip right in after the last to save time. press finished seams to the side.\nslide the pith tube over the bottom of the fruit, matching seams. here i like to ���bisect and pin.��� pin at the side seams, then pull both layers taut. align edges and pin in the center. then hold at a side seam and the center pin taught, and put a pin in the middle. repeat for the other side, working around the skirt until you���ve pinned all the way. this distributes any extra fullness along the entire skirt rather than starting to pin on one side and finding out you were off somewhere along the other end (it also works great for knit neckline binding).\nsew, then finish, then press toward the darker fabric (here it���s the fruit).\nfold your rind in half lengthwise wrong sides together, and press so your raw edges align.\nslide the rind over the skirt, aligning the seams and pinning the raw edges as you did with the pith to the fruit. sew, then finish. press toward the rind.\nthis is what your skirt will look like from the right side and wrong side.\neither serge the raw top edge or fold under 1/4��� then another 1 1/2.��� press and pin. i like to use a green and red pin along the center back to mark where to leave the gap for my elastic. sew at 1 1/4��� (just within the serge seam), leaving about a 1.5��� gap in the center for the elastic. i also like to stitch about 1/8��� all the way around the top waistband to prevent the elastic from twisting.\ncut a length of elastic to size (child���s waist measurement), then shape into a circle like it will sit in the skirt and mark arrows at each end with a water soluble pen. the parts at the edges of the arrows extend upward and will help you align them later. attach a safety pin to one end, and a clothespin to the other. feed the elastic through the gap using the safety pin ��� the clothespin will prevent you from losing the tail on the other end. when you get back to the gap, remove the pins and match up your arrows, making sure they haven���t twisted. overlap the elastic about 3/4��� and sew a square in it to secure, then spread out the waistband so it retreats up in there.\ninsert a ribbon or size tag into the gap, then sew closed. distribute the fullness toward the back of the skirt.\nyou���re DONE! fresh and fun and ready for summer! with no hemming, these really are very quick to make. if you make a skirt using this tutorial, please add it to the skirt as top flickr group!\nif you make any skirts to donate to foster care, be sure to add them to the skirting the issue flickr group for your chance to win prizes (as well as the general ���warm fuzzies��� you get for doing a good deed)!\nhere are a few foster care agencies in the portland area for those looking to donate (thanks to kat for helping find these!):\nplease call first to make sure you���ve got the proper address before sending your skirts; i didn���t verify them and we want our skirts going to the right place! some also have specific donation wishlists for you to consider.\nhappy sewing, all you do-gooders!",

Too many will find these agencies to be unresponsive, bureaucratic, and unwelcoming. Many will give up in frustration. Waiting children will wonder why “no one wants me”. The parents who want to adopt will wonder, “Why is it so hard to adopt?” There is no irony more tragic in America. Fact: There are far more people wanting to adopt children from foster care than there are children in need of families:\n- Joint research by Harvard University and the Urban Institute documented that in any given year, 240,000 Americans will call for information about adopting a child from foster care. Only a tiny fraction of these prospective parents, less than 4%, will actually adopt a child from foster care.\n- According to the most recent National Survey of Family Growth, 600,000 American women were actively trying to adopt a child. The overwhelming number were interested in adopting a child that fit the profile of those in foster care. For every black child in foster care there are 12 prospective parents actively trying to adopt who would be willing to adopt a black child. For every child between 6 and 12 years of age, there are 8 prospective parents. For every child 13 years and older, there are 6 prospective parents.\nDespite the documented fact that there are far more parents wanting to adopt than children available, each year, 30,000 children age out of foster care leaving foster care at 18 with no family, no resources and, all too often, no future.\nCollaborating with child welfare leaders and experts from around the country, Listening to Parents works to eliminate the barriers that prevent children in need of families from being adopted by the families that want to adopt them.\nChange is possible. The Adoption and Safe Families Act of 1997 was designed to double the number of children adopted from foster care within five years. The skeptics were wrong. It took only three years to double the number of children adopted from foster care each year, from 25,000 to over 50,000.\nWe can create that kind of change again. Please join us.",

        "1¢ Statue of Columbus Stamp\nNot long after the U.S. issued overprinted stamps for use in Cuba, new stamps were designed and printed by the U.S. Bureau of Engraving and Printing. The first of these stamps pictures a statue of Columbus, who first discovered the islands in 1492 and named them for the ancient town of Cuba in Beja, Portugal.\nFew of these scarce Cuba stamps still exist. Over time these stamps may become even more difficult to find, so order now.\nFew U.S. Cuba Overprint Stamps Survive!\nWhen the U.S. Battleship Maine mysteriously exploded after being sent to Cuba to protect Americans caught in Cuba’s war for independence, Spain was blamed. Soon after, war was declared and America took administrative control of Cuba as well as Guam, Puerto Rico and the Philippines. The United States established a military government to run Cuba from 1898 until 1902, when the nation’s first president was elected.\nAlthough many native Cubans were angered by U.S. policies, social conditions improved a great deal during the American occupation. Most important was the effort led by Dr. Walter Reed to combat the deadly “yellow fever.”\nAs an emergency measure in 1899, U.S. stamps were overprinted for use in Cuba. The overprinted stamps included the 1894 Bureau issues and the Series of 1898-99, stamps that were commonly available at that time. Shortly after, the emerging republic issued engraved pictorial stamps with distinctly Cuban themes that included Christopher Columbus, royal palms, and ocean liners.\nTwo years later, Cuba drafted its own constitution and U.S. military administration in Cuba ended in 1902 with the formation of the Republic of Cuba. In less than four years, Spain’s colonization of the Caribbean and Philippines had ended, and the United States emerged as a world leader.\nU.S. Places Embargo On Cuban Goods\nOn October 19, 1960, President Dwight D. Eisenhower established the first embargo on Cuba.\nThe U.S. and Cuba have had a long and tumultuous shared history. The Spanish first settled Cuba in 1511. Colonists grew sugar cane and tobacco on large plantations, relying on the forced labor of native peoples.\nCuba’s Spanish settlers became increasingly dissatisfied with Spain’s rule and many revolutionary groups were formed. By the mid-1800s, many Cubans and Americans favored making Cuba part of the United States. The U.S. government made several attempts to buy Cuba from Spain, but Spain refused them.\nThe Cubans eventually took up arms against the Spanish due to a lack of political power and rising taxes. By the late 1800s, many Americans wanted to intervene in the conflict. Following the explosion of the American battleship Maine in Havana Harbor, the U.S. officially declared war on Spain. By August 1898, the Spanish surrendered. The U.S. emerged as a world power and gained the territories of Guam, Puerto Rico, and the Philippine Islands.\nAfter the Spanish-American War, the U.S. established a military government in Cuba. Cuba adopted a constitution in 1901. The constitution contained provisions called the Platt Amendment, which allowed the U.S. to intervene in Cuban affairs. It also allowed the U.S. to buy or lease land for naval bases in Cuba. In 1903, the U.S. received a permanent lease to build a naval base on Guantánamo Bay.\nOver the next 50 years, Cuba was in a state of unrest, with new governments forming and frequent revolts by and against Fulgencio Batista. Among those opposed to Batista’s dictatorship was Fidel Castro. Castro circulated a petition calling for deposing the illegal Batista government. This proved ineffective.\nOn July 26, 1953, Castro attempted to start a revolution by leading an attack on the Moncada Army Barracks in Santiago de Cuba. This proved disastrous. Castro and many of his followers were imprisoned. Castro was released from prison in 1955. He formed the 26th of July Movement, a revolutionary group named after the date of his first revolt. Castro took his group to Mexico, where they could organize safely.\nIn December 1956, Castro’s forces landed in eastern Cuba. Most of Castro’s rebels were quickly killed – but Castro and 11 others managed to escape into the Sierra Maestra Mountains. From the mountains they waged a guerrilla war against the Batista government.\nBatista’s increasingly unpopular dictatorship provided fertile ground for Castro’s 26th of July Movement. The dictator’s attempts to neutralize Castro and his men made the rebels more popular with the people. By mid-1958, public support for Batista was crumbling. On January 1, 1959, Batista fled Cuba.\nCastro’s forces quickly took control of the country. The old government was dismantled – many former political officials and military officers were executed. By mid-February, Castro was sworn in as prime minister. The U.S. supported Castro’s government… until American-owned properties in Cuba were seized. Relations declined sharply.\nIn the spring of 1960, President Dwight D. Eisenhower approved a plan to embargo sugar, oil and guns. Then in June, U.S. oil companies refused to refine oil in Cuba that had been delivered by the Soviet Union. Eisenhower then cut the Cuban sugar quota by 95 percent. None of this deterred Castro, who continued to nationalize American business and commercial properties. As a result, President Eisenhower enacted a trade embargo against Cuba on October 19, 1960.\nEisenhower’s embargo outlawed all U.S. exports to Cuba except medicine and some food. President Kennedy later expanded the embargo to include all U.S. imports from Cuba.\nOn April 16, 1961, Castro declared Cuba a socialist state. A one-party Communist system was established. Castro pursued a close relationship with the Soviet Union and enacted many Soviet-styled, state-controlled agricultural and industrial “reforms.” The Soviet Union contributed a great deal of financial aid to Cuba – the nation’s economy grew very dependent upon this assistance.\nAs “the revolution” grew more radical, large numbers of Cubans fled their country. Once exiled in America, many of these exiles worked to undermine Castro’s regime. In 1959, a group of anti-Castro exiles even hired U.S. planes and flew over Cuba, dropping leaflets and small firebombs.\nIn the coming years, the Bay of Pigs Invasion and the Cuban Missile Crisis placed the nation in the international spotlight as people all over the world nervously anticipated nuclear war. Finally, the U.S.S.R. agreed to remove the missiles. In return, the U.S. promised not to attack Cuba. Defiant as ever, Castro protested this decision to the Soviets. Although the missiles were removed, thousands of Soviet troops remained in Cuba.\nDuring the late 1980s, the Soviet Union and its satellite nations in Eastern Europe began to ease their political and economic restrictions. Castro criticized these efforts. In 1991, the Soviet Union ceased to exist – the end of an era in world history. This meant an end to Soviet financial aid to Cuba, worth about $4-5 billion a year. However, Castro declared Cuba would remain Communist.\nCuba’s economy was further damaged by increased economic restrictions from the U.S., enacted in 1992 and 1996. In response, Castro loosened some restrictions on the economy and allowed many Cubans to leave the country. Investment, especially in tourism, from Canada, Europe, and Latin America has enabled Cuba to stage a modest economic recovery. Perhaps the most progressive of Castro’s new policies is the opening of “free trade zones,” where companies are allowed to import and export goods without seeking permission from the government.\nOn July 31, 2006, Fidel Castro underwent surgery and had to assign presidential power to his brother, Raúl Castro, temporarily. Though his health reportedly improved somewhat after surgery, Fidel Castro decided to officially resign from the presidency in 2008 – his brother replaced him.\nDuring his time as president of Cuba, Raúl Castro has implemented many economic reforms – some even reversing laws put in place by his brother. One of the biggest achievements Raúl Castro has made was in December 2014 when he and U.S. President Barack Obama negotiated renewed diplomacy between the United States and Cuba. The two countries officially returned to full diplomatic relations on July 20, 2015. On March 20, 2016, President Obama was the first sitting U.S. President to visit Cuba in 88 years.\nIn the summer of 2016, relations between the United States and Cuba slowly improved. U.S. President Barack Obama has continued to urge Congress to lift the embargo on Cuba. Meanwhile, embassies in both countries have re-opened, and all signs point to relations continuing to improve.",

        "When director Zack Synder's reimagining of George Romero's watershed zombie epic Dawn of the Dead (1978) was announced, no amount of outrage in the horror community was spared. How could Romero's independent, unrated splatter classic (this was the very film, in fact, that Romero coined the term 'splatter movie' for) possibly be translated into an R-rated studio film? Even worse, this atrocity was going to be helmed by a music video director who had never directed a feature film - and it was scripted by James Gunn, who at the time was known mostly as the writer from the godawful live-action Scooby-Doo. If there was ever a film that had fandom united in anticipation of impending suckitude, the Dawn of the Dead remake was it. To call it a hard sell to the horror crowd doesn't even cover the amount of animosity that Dawn of the Dead '04 had to overcome.\nAnd that's why this trailer is one of the all-time greats - because it immediately turned the tide of opinion on this movie.

        "Scottish Terriers have small, compact, sturdy frames covered in coarse, wiry, weatherproof coats that usually come in black, brindle or wheaten colors. Their long heads have full muzzles, square jaws, pointy ears and widely set eyes. Their intense stare has often been called “varminty.” Scotties have thick necks that slope down to short, cobby bodies with broad chests and short but powerful legs. Their thick, tapered tails are usually carried high.\nSporty and playful, Scottish Terriers bring a high-spirited energy to any household. Perfectly at home in apartments, houses or grand estates, Scotties have a distinctive charm that can be both amusing and bewildering at the same time. They are a proud breed, full of happiness, dignity and toughness. Most of all, they love companionship—give your Scottie plenty of that, and it will be your ever-loving pal.\nDon’t be fooled by their size: Scotties make terrific watchdogs. In fact, you’d be hard pressed to find a more formidable little scrapper. Protective and fearless when their environments are threatened, they also know when to show restraint. They are somewhat reserved with people outside the family circle—some might even call them aloof—but as long as they are properly introduced to new friends they will be perfectly charming.\nScotties need exercise, attention and activity to stay physically and mentally sharp. If you leave them in the back yard for hours at a time, you’re asking for trouble: Scottish Terriers love to dig. And when they’re bored, they can get up to all sorts of other mischief. Make sure your Scottie gets plenty of walks, including special times off the leash in a controlled environment.\nA healthy Scottish Terrier can live as long as 15 years. Common health issues include epilepsy and von Willebrand disease (a prolonged bleeding disorder). They are also susceptible to something called “Scottie Cramp,” when the muscles randomly lock up. This usually occurs during exercise and can last for a few minutes.\nScotties need to be brushed regularly. During shedding seasons, they should be brushed daily (at least). Scottish Terriers need to be professionally groomed several times a year.\nBred long and low to follow foxes, rabbits and badgers into their dens, the Scottish Terrier either dates from the 19th century or the 15th century depending on who’s doing the talking. For many years, various terriers including the Skye and Yorkshire were lumped into the “Scottish Terrier” category, angering some purists. To set matters straight, the Scottish Terrier Clubs of England and Scotland were formed in the early 1880s. Today, the Scottish Terrier—along with the West Highland—are considered the oldest of the Highland Terriers.",
        "Excerpt from \"Safer Birth in a Barn?\" Midwifery Today, Issue 83\nposted with permission\nThe protocols in the world of animal husbandry to protect an offspring at the time of birth—no strangers, dimmed lights, freedom of movement, familiar environment, unlimited nourishment, respectful quiet, no disruptions—are done without hesitation because to do otherwise invites \"unexplained distress\" or sudden demise of the offspring. These thoughtful conditions are the norm, along with careful observation to determine when to use the technological expertise in true emergencies. When we have veterinarians in our childbirth education classes, they always start to smile and nod when I tell this story. These are givens—instinctive givens, even, for animals of all descriptions!\nYet what are the \"givens\" for the human who births not in a barn, but in a \"modern and advanced\" hospital? In many cases, 100% the opposite! Usually a minimum of a dozen strangers pass through the world of the laboring mother in her first 12 hours in the hospital—security officer, patient transporter, triage secretary, admission clerk, triage nurse, resident and/or doctor on call, admitting nurse, first shift nurse, break nurse, additional nurse at delivery, doctor or midwife plus possibly students, anesthesiologist, pediatrician, etc. Bright lights in the triage and labor rooms are challenging to dim. Mothers are tethered to monitors or IV poles and are moved through a bright hall with unfamiliar sounds to a new room in a building devoted to illness/trauma that most have visited once briefly if at all. They receive poor quality \"clear liquids only.\" They are exposed to voices of others in the hall or chatting by the attendants during contractions and endless disruptions throughout! But then, do we ever find that we have an offspring experience \"unexplained distress?\" Of course, and at frightening rates! Yet, oddly, many of these disruptions are promoted as minor inconveniences or necessary to \"protect\" the baby.\nCuriously, while veterinarians commonly have to defend interventions in light of the additional cost and the risks associated with interfering with nature, providers caring for human mothers within the medical system more commonly are forced to defend why they did NOT intervene! Consider the high rates of inductions, epidurals, artificial rupture of membranes, immediate cord cutting, cesareans and the vigorous defense necessary to fight for anything different, especially if time is involved (time to go into labor, to progress, to push, to allow the cord to stop pulsation or to get \"done\" bonding). I've recently seen outstanding CNMs and obstetricians sacrifice their own political reputations and suffer departmental reprimands for births with great outcomes where they protected the mothers' yearning for privacy, allowed extended pushing time with great vital signs or, during a healthy normal birth, followed their intuition and honored the mother's begging to check heart tones frequently by hand during pushing instead of what the mother considered the massive intrusion of wearing the monitor belt. Interventions are considered to be the ultimate protection from litigation in human care, yet they contribute mightily to the high rates of distress in mothers and babies!\nIn animal husbandry, the first line of defense for protecting the unborn is to protect and nurture the nutritional needs and comfort of the birthing female. In the case of institutionalized birth for humans, however, in spite of evidence to the contrary, the norm is to act as if the nutritional needs and the comfort of the birthing mothers are of concern to, at most, the marketing and public relations department! It's an affront to common sense that as a society we are currently more accepting of the needs of foaling mares, whelping poodles and high-producing cows than of our birthing humans. From the high rates of fetal distress, meconium staining and breastfeeding problems, the consequences are clearly devastating to our infants, just as any decent horseman would predict.\n\"I'd take birthing in a barn over birthing in a hospital any day...\"\nPosted by Creeping Starfish on Jul 6, 2008",
        "New Chapter Day! [This post has been found in violation of H.R. 3261 S.O.P.A. and has been removed]January 18, 2012\nThe new chapter is ready. It would have gone up today, but instead, it will be released tomorrow so I can add just one small voice to the SOPA Blackout in progress at Wikipedia, Reddit, and other sites trying to spread awareness of the “Stop Online Piracy Act” or SOPA bill which the US Congress will vote on next week.\nThe bill is superficially about copyright protection and intellectual property. It sounds plausible, movies are big business. I’m as worried as anyone about the disproportionate amount of power corporations have gained over US lawmakers, but I think we can all agree that if Warner Brothers is spending upwards of $100,000,000 on The Dark Knight Rises, it’s not unreasonable for them to ask us $10 a head to watch it rather than having anyone able to download it for free.\nBUT this legislation that is allegedly about pirated movies and TV shows has provisions to snuff out any website, arrest those who even maintain a site that LINKS to objectionable content, and essentially impose China-modeled controls over the Internet in the United States. This proposed legislation also seems to have surfaced immediately after WikiLeaks.\nThere is a history in this country of a government that cannot go after people for one thing – like, say, protesting the war in Vietnam – finding a way to go after them for something else that many of them do – like, say, smoking marijuana.\nThere is no social site out there where people are forwarding a Huffington Post article about Ron Paul where somebody isn’t also sharing a YouTube from The Brave and the Bold cartoon. There is no blog network where somebody hasn’t posted a still photo from Twilight made into a faux motivational poster about Edward being the lovespawn of Dracula and Tinkerbell.\nANY SOCIAL NETWORK and ANY WEBSITE can be shut down under SOPA, and a case can be made against any one of us. This is an attack on free speech in the one medium left that corporations cannot control, where this little gal writing a fan fiction series can shout just as loud as Time Warner, and where the merits of each view decides who the audience will go back to, not the advertising budget behind it.\nWhether you are political or not, like Cat-Tales or not, whatever it is you want to say online, this is a time to call your Congressman and tell them to oppose SOPA. Because whatever other positions they hold, it doesn’t make much difference if they give on this one. This is the dealbreaker, folks. This is the one that snuffs out our ability to talk about all the others.\nSOPA is not about copyright or piracy. It is about censorship and free speech. Use it loose it, guys. Use it or lose it.",
        "Ford B-Max vs. Fiat 500L, I know you are not very familiar with this type of article in this space. But time-to-time, I want to share my opinions with you.\nFord B-Max and Fiat 500L are the small family MPVs. Ford B-Max offers more conservative design with sliding rear doors and Fiat 500L is the Fiat 500 with steroids. In my opinion, Fiat 500L has a better design in both exterior and interior than the Ford B-Max. But this does not mean that Ford B-Max does not look good, it also does! Especially the sliding rear doors are very practical for tight parking spaces and loading items to rear seats.\nWhat I perceive from these two cars, Fiat 500L is more fashionable small family MPV for families whom do not wish to vanish their sense of fashion due to their larger family. On the other hand, Ford B-Max is designed for practicality more than fashion sense. It is definitely for families whose primary concern is the practicality!\nBoth Ford and Fiat are in similar price range in many market however, due to taxation for different engines size you may see difference prices.\nFord B-Max offers petrol engines of 1.4-lt 90 HP, 1-lt Turbo EcoBoost 100 / 120 HP and 1.6-lt 105 HP for PowerShift automatic gearbox. Diesel are; 1.5-lt 75 HP and 1.6-lt 95 HP. Except 1.6-lt petrol engine rest of the range is offered with 5-speed manual. This is the only disadvantage of Ford B-Max, limited automatic gearbox option and 5-speed manual.\nFiat 500L offers petrol engines of 1.4-lt 95 HP and 0.9-lt 105 HP.

        "The Occupational Safety and Health Administration recommends some pre-work stretching and flex exercises to help reduce injuries. Stretching helps reduce musculoskeletal disorders and muscle-related discomfort, according to OH&S, the Occupational Health and Safety Administration's online magazine.\nStretching Your Back\nFor back stretches, stand with your feet spread apart and put your hands on your hips. Slowly bend backward until you start to feel a bit of tension, then hold this position for five seconds. Lean back forward, relax for five seconds, then repeat.\nReturn to your starting position, but place your arms down to your sides. Reach one hand up above your head at a time and gradually lean to the other side and stretch for five seconds. Return again to the starting position and repeat with your other arm.\nStretch out your thighs by lifting your right leg up behind you and holding your ankle with your right hand. Use your arm to pull up on your ankle and stretch your thigh. Balance yourself by holding your left arm out to the side or holding onto something stable. Release your right leg, then repeat with the other side.\nStretch your hamstrings by placing your left foot on a bucket that stands around 12 inches. With that leg straight on the bucket, gradually bend at the hip until you start to feel some tension. Hold this position for five seconds, then switch and do the right side.\nUpper Body Stretches\nStretch your shoulders and chest by sticking your arms out to your side, then bend your elbows until your fingers are pointing toward the ceiling. Gently pull your arms back, squeezing your shoulder blades together. Hold this for five seconds, relax for five seconds, and then repeat.\nFor forearm stretches, begin by holding your arms out straight in front of your body. Face your palms down, make a loose fist, then gently bend your fist down and rotate your wrist. Hold your fist in this position for five seconds, relax for five seconds, and then repeat.\nTaking short breaks from what you're doing can also be helpful and decrease work injuries, according to OSHA. Doing your job can sometimes cause you to stay in awkward positions for excessive periods of time, which can lead to wear and tear or localized fatigue. When you're doing an activity continuously, whether it's at your desk or out in the field, try to take short breaks, switch to other positions or try to do other tasks to work different muscles groups while allowing those you've been using to rest.",

        "The Transmission of Disease\nHarmful organisms that can be transmitted from pet waste to children and adults can persist for on the ground for weeks, months, even years. Round worm eggs, for one, which infect an estimated 14% of Americans, do just fine on the ground for up to three years and are easily picked up on shoes, paws or feet, including barefoot humans. If bacteria are on the grass, they'll can easily hitch a ride into your house. A 2008 study by the University of Arizona found up to 99% of fecal pathogens transfer easily onto clean floors inside the home via shoes. Fecal coliform and other bacteria found in dog waste can make people sick, leading to breathing problems, diarrhea, blindness and worse. Some of the diseases that can be spread to humans from pet waste include,\n- Campylobacteriosis (a bacterial infection frequently causing diarrhea in humans)\n- Salmonellosis (the most common bacterial infection transmitted to humans -- symptoms include fever, muscle aches, headache, vomiting, and diarrhea)\n- Toxocarisis (roundworms transmitted from animals to humans. Symptoms include vision loss, rash, fever, or cough)\n- Fecal coliform causes dysentery, hepatitis, typhoid fever and ear infections\n- Roundworm, giardiasis, tuberculosis, gastroenteritis and cryptosporidiosis\n- Cysticercosis which is a disease of humans involving larval tapeworms in the human body\nWith 1.2 million dogs in the greater Dallas, Texas area, that’s the sewage equivalent of a city almost as large as Dallas with no toilets. DFW dogs produce some 900,000 pounds of sewage per day which contaminating the environment, especially groundwater, area lakes and the Trinity River.\nVolunteers from Texas Stream Team working with the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ) conduct monthly tests to monitor water quality of the White Rock Lake watershed which feeds directly into the Trinity. TCEQ standards for water quality include a maximum of 126 colony forming units (CFUs) of E. Coli bacteria which come from warm-blooded animals such as humans, dogs, and coyotes. Some of the prime tributaries feeding the lake include White Rock Creek, Skillman Branch Creek, Williamson Creek, and the Dixon Branch Creek. All of them are toxic with E. Coli.\nDog waste is not “fertilizer”\nSome people assume dog waste is okay for composting but the EPA says NO! unless you like flowers and vegetables impreganated with toxic bacteria. Eating a tomato with fecal bacteria inside of it is about the same as sprinkling dog waste in your cereal = not recommended. Composting does not kill the smorgasbord of harmful pathogens in dog waste that attack humans and pets. Fecal coliform bacteria are just one of a whole suite of pathogens that can thrive in a compost pile and wind up inside \"bacteria-bomb\" vegetables!\nIgnoring the above-ground sewage in your backyard is going the way of bloodletting and other harmful practices held over from darker, less enlightened times. A waste treatment facility or landfill is set up to contain fecal matter. Your backyard is not. Watch this short video demonstration to learn more.\n- Learn more about Sgt.
